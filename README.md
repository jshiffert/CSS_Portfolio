# CSS_Portfolio
This repository supports a sample developer's portfolio. This portfolio site has links at the top of the page which direct the user to different sections of the page. This page uses different CSS properties to display a grid of example projects for the portfolio. The projects are responsive when a user hovers over them with a mouse.
